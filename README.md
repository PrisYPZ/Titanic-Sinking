# Titanic-Sinking
This project focuses on building machine learning model to predict Survived people in Titanic sinking by using Python sklearn Decision Tree algorithm. The model can be used to predict whether the people can survive in the disaster and help enhance safety measures

•	Using Python data cleaning and preprocessing skills to understand data size and prepare for building Decision Tree model to make prediction via Jupyter notebook

•	Designing a Decision Tree machine learning model to help predict if a passenger could survive in unexpected situations by using sklearn package and data transforming techniques

•	Implementing forecasting techniques to lower the occurrence of unexpected situation and enhance survival rate

•	Provide meaningful insights to reduce death toll under unexpected disaster
